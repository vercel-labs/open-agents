# Sandbox lifecycle

This document describes how sandbox lifecycle management works, including automatic hibernation and manual restore.

## Timeouts

| Constant | Test | Production | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `DEFAULT_SANDBOX_TIMEOUT_MS` | 3 min | 5 hours | Hard VM expiry from Vercel |
| `SANDBOX_INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_MS` | 1 min | 30 min | Inactivity window before hibernate |

Configured in `lib/sandbox/config.ts`.

## State machine

```

Where **I** = inactivity timeout, **H** = hard timeout.

When the hard timeout is reached while the sandbox is still active, it hibernates the same way as inactivity — snapshot and stop. The user can manually resume if needed. This is simpler than automatic rollover and sufficient because the hard timeout (5 hours) is long enough that inactivity hibernation will almost always trigger first.

## How workflows work

Each lifecycle event calls `kickSandboxLifecycleWorkflow()`, which calls `start(sandboxLifecycleWorkflow, ...)` to create a **new, independent durable workflow run** via the Vercel Workflow DevKit.

A single workflow run does:

1. Read session from DB
2. Compute `wakeAtMs = hibernateAfter`
3. `sleep(wakeAtMs)` — durable sleep that survives deploys and serverless cold starts
4. Wake up and evaluate:
   - **User inactive** (`now >= hibernateAfter`) → **hibernate** (snapshot + stop)
   - **Still active** → **skip** ("not-due-yet"), then retry once with fresh DB state
5. Exit

### Multiple concurrent workflows

Each kick creates a new run. Multiple runs can coexist for the same session. This is safe because:

- They all sleep until different wake times based on when they were kicked
- The first one to act (hibernate) clears runtime state
- Subsequent runs wake up, see no operable sandbox, and exit immediately
- Workflow runs are cheap — sleep is free

### Example timeline

```
T=0:00  Create sandbox → kick W1 (sleeps until T=1:00)

T=0:30  User sends message
        chat-started: refresh activity, hibernateAfter=1:30
        kick W2 (sleeps until T=1:30)

T=0:45  Chat finishes
        chat-finished: refresh activity, hibernateAfter=1:45
        kick W3 (sleeps until T=1:45)

T=1:00  W1 wakes → now < hibernateAfter(1:45) → SKIP
        retry: re-compute, sleep until 1:45

T=1:30  W2 wakes → now < hibernateAfter(1:45) → SKIP
        retry: re-compute, sleep until 1:45

T=1:45  W1, W2, W3 all wake
        First to evaluate: now >= hibernateAfter → HIBERNATE
        Others: see no operable sandbox → SKIP and exit
```

## Events that kick workflows

| Event | Reason | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Sandbox created | `sandbox-created` | `POST /api/sandbox` |
| Cloud sandbox ready (hybrid handoff) | `cloud-ready` | `onCloudSandboxReady` hook |
| Chat request received | `chat-started` | `POST /api/chat` (before streaming) |
| Chat response finished | `chat-finished` | `POST /api/chat` (`onFinish`) |
| Manual extend | `timeout-extended` | `POST /api/sandbox/extend` |
| Manual snapshot | `manual-snapshot` | `POST /api/sandbox/snapshot` |
| Snapshot restore | `snapshot-restored` | `PUT /api/sandbox/snapshot` |
| Status poll finds overdue sandbox | `status-check-overdue` | `GET /api/sandbox/status` |

## Activity tracking

`lastActivityAt` and `hibernateAfter` are refreshed:

- **At chat start** — prevents hibernation during long-running AI responses
- **At chat finish** — resets the inactivity window after each interaction
- **On sandbox create/extend/restore** — resets after manual lifecycle events

These are **not** refreshed on:
- **Reconnect probes** — otherwise every page load defeats the inactivity timer
- **Status polling** — read-only DB check, no side effects on activity

## Safety nets

1. **Status endpoint** (`GET /api/sandbox/status`) — polled every 15s by the client. If the sandbox is overdue for hibernation but the lifecycle hasn't acted, kicks a workflow via `after()`.
2. **Workflow retry** — if evaluation returns "not-due-yet" (activity happened during sleep), re-computes wake time and tries once more before exiting.
3. **Inline fallback** — if `start(workflow)` fails (workflow SDK unavailable in dev), runs `evaluateSandboxLifecycle()` synchronously as a fallback.

## Client-side UI sync

The client polls `GET /api/sandbox/status` every 15s to get the server's view of lifecycle state. The UI derives sandbox status from:

- **Server lifecycle state** (`active`, `hibernated`, `hibernating`, etc.) — primary source
- **Local sandbox info** (`createdAt + timeout`) — secondary, for countdown display

The status chip shows:
- **Active** — server says active AND local timeout hasn't expired
- **Paused** — server says hibernated, or no runtime sandbox state with a snapshot available
- **No sandbox** — no runtime state and no snapshot

A forced status sync fires immediately after each chat completion (`streaming → ready`) to minimize the gap between server state change and UI update.
